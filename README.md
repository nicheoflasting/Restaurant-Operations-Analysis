This is a small project of business analysis through using SQL

## Purpose: 

Dig into the customer data to see which menu items are doing well / not well and what the top customers seem to like best

## The Objectives:

* Explore the menu_items to get an idea of what's on the new menu
* Explore the order_details to get an idea of the data collected
* Use both tables to understand how customers are reacting to the new menu
